# LLM Selection Decision

| Decision Factor | My Choice | Reason (1 sentence) |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Which LLM followed my prompt structure most faithfully? | ChatGPT | Strictly adhered to the defined 6-layer format with consistent sections across all layers. |
| Which LLM was most technically accurate (least hallucination)? | ChatGPT | Used conservative language ("likely") and avoided making unsupported claims about specific technologies. |
| Which LLM's output was most readable and well-organized? | ChatGPT | Produced clean markdown structure with clear headers and concise explanations. |
| Which LLM handled the "honesty check" best (admitting when a layer doesn't apply)? | Claude | Explicitly mentioned when LLM layers were not central to the product and explained why. |

**Selected LLM for final tool:** ChatGPT  

**Why:** ChatGPT provided the best balance of structured output, technical accuracy, and low hallucination risk, which is critical for a reusable AI architecture analysis tool. While Claude offered better reasoning depth in some areas, ChatGPT was more reliable for consistent, production-ready outputs.
